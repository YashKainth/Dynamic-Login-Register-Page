# Button Highlighter

This is a basic HTML and JavaScript example that demonstrates how to add a class to a button when it is clicked. The code includes an HTML button with an `onclick` function that adds a CSS class to highlight the button when clicked.

## How it Works

When you click the "Click Me" button, the JavaScript function `myFunction()` is triggered. This function finds the button by its `id` attribute and adds the "highlight" class to it. The "highlight" class is defined in the CSS to change the button's background color to yellow.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Click the "Login/Register" button to see the highlighting effect in action.

## Customize

You can customize the highlighting effect by modifying the CSS in the `<style>` section of the HTML file. Adjust the colors and styles to match your preferences.
